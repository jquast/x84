Well, here we are, after nearly a year we've finally released a new version of x/84, version 2.0.0.

It's been a tough road, we've gotten a lot of new additions since the last release to pypi:

   - sftp and ssh server
   - intra-bbs messaging
   - web server
   - split screen chat
   - improved message area
   - improved irc client
   - hacker news reader
   - ami/x artwork and styling
   - file browser
   - xmodem support
   - shroo.ms api for oneliners
   - voting booth
   - improved profile editor

Special thanks to |03haliphax|07 and |03hellbeard|07 and all the many folks of #1984 who have encouraged this release.

There are now several boards running x/84:

    telnet://|02bloodisland.ph4.se|07
    telnet://|02bbs.beardy.se|07
    telnet://|02bbs.maze.io|07
    telnet://|02ufud.eu:6023|07
    telnet://|02oddnetwork.org|07

Special thanks to |03haliphax|07, |03hellbeard|07, |03beardy|07, |03maze|07, and |03megagumbo|07 for contributing to this release.  |03haliphax|07 and the team have contributed a web module with a json-formatted REST API that provides intra-bbs messaging.  With all the new activity on the message base, we're looking to improve it in the next release.

We're pounding out bugs and creating a more homogeneous style for the default board.  |03maze|07 has contributed solid cp437 and amiga topaz encoding for utf8 translations, and helped improve ssh.

Ssh support is complete -- you can ssh anonymous@, new@, or your_username@1984.ws and connect securely.  Ssh provides a lower latency than connection than telnet.  pubkey authentication is also supported.

Release 1.1.0 has been reached -- 10 iterations!

As for the terminal support in x/84, this has now been published as an independent package, |02blessed|07 and re-used within x/84, but can be used independently -- you can build your own python apps upon it:

  |02https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blessed/

For example, somebody recently created a 2048 clone with 'blessed':

Release 1.0.9 is now on pypi.  New features include a revamped 'weather' program, and some new art from xzip!impure.  Otherwise, various bugs were resolved.  Thanks to a few folk now running the bbs and providing feedback.

Meanwhile, Mercyful of telnet://|03htc.zapto.org|07 has been (ab)using this bbs as a gatewaying host to test UTF-8<=>CP437 translation -- his bbs now also supports UTF-8.

As for blessings, the upstream author has not been accepting patches, delayed over 1 year now.  I will fork the project, tentatively named 'blessed'.

x/84 version 1.0.4 has been released to pypi, to install:

   $ |02pip install x84

To upgrade:

   $ |02pip install --upgrade x84

This release improves editing and message reading capabilities.  You may have noticed Colors in this news item, which is safe to use in pager and lightbars, either with sequences or by using 'pipes', such as '||02' for the color |02green|07.

If you need to use a literal pipe, just use two. (a||||b).
