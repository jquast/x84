2.0.0
  - you will need to ensure to set 'enabled = yes' for the shroo-ms api,
    previously this was enabled if the section alone existed
  - you will need to change the values of `newcmds', `anoncmds',
    and 'byecmds' of section [matrix] to be comma-delimited,
    not space-delimited as before. Similarly, you must also change
    value of 'invalid_handles' in section [nua].
  - the meaning of [system] option 'termcap-ansi', when not valued 'no', now
    coerces any reported terminal types *beginning* with 'ansi' to
    the target type.
  - fail2ban is enabled by [fail2ban] option 'enabled = yes'. Previously,
    the mere existence of section [fail2ban] was sufficient.
  - *new* option, 'anoncmds' in section 'matrix', where previously only
    the 'anonymous' user was a legitimate synonym, you may now provide
    many different ones -- humorously, you could provide 'root'.
  - *new* option, 'script_ssh' in section 'matrix', points to a new
    login matrix script that takes new keyword arguments, 'anonymous',
    or 'new' as booleans True or False, or user keyword argument as
    string representing the (already authenticated) user handle.
  - keyword arguments for gosub() and goto() are now supported.
  - ssh key authentication support
  - *removed*: x84.bbs.log.ColoredConsoleHandler.
    If you see exception: ``ImportError: No module named log``
    simply change line, ``class = x84.bbs.log.ColoredConsoleHandler``
    to new line, ``class = logging.StreamHandler``
    in your ~/.x84/logging.ini or /etc/x84/logging.ini file!
  - new bulletins, userlist, from hellbeard
  - new door 'sesame.py' script, from maze
  - project 'blessed' has been merged. Some minor API changes that
    currently just emit a DeprecationWarning, will be removed in 2.0,
    especially in regards to sequence-safe textwrap() function, one
    should instead use term.wrap().
  - project 'wcwidth' has been merged. No change.
  - move_x now works for screen/etc. TERM types (fixed in blessed).
  - ssh server support: for existing servers, simply add a new section
    to your default.ini::
    [ssh]
    addr = 127.0.0.1
    port = 6022
    hostkey = /my/path/to/.x84/ssh_host_rsa_key
    hostkeybits = 2048
  - rudimentary web.py-based web server module (webserve.py) for API
    endpoints.
    This requires both pyOpenSSL and web.py packages, which are not
    installed by default by setup.py. It is configured with the [web]
    default.ini section (the "chain" setting is optional; only use it
    if you have a chained cert):
    [web]
    addr = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8443
    cert = /home/bbs/ssl.cer
    key = /home/bbs/ssl.key
    chain = /home/bbs/chain.cer
  - message network server web API endpoint (webmodules/msgserve.py).
  - message network REST client for pull/push (msgpoll.py).

1.1.0

  - fix issue #38: chat buffer lost on resize
  - fix issue #43: bordering math issues in msgreader
  - pull request #46, #47, #50, #54: misc. dropfile bugfixes (haliphax)
  - pull request #45: resolves CP437 issue with output_filter (haliphax)

1.0.9
  - tagging no longer requires 'moderator' or 'sysop' group by default,
    is now configurable with .ini options of section [msg]:
    moderated_tags: yes/no, tag_moderators: list of groups
  - yet even more fixes for bad xml bytes in bbs-scene.org's onelinerz api
  - thanks to xzip, weather now looks like a television broadcast layout.
  - a short/malicious sub-negotiation string will not cause engine crash.
  - default board recieved some new ami/x-style art from xzip!impure
  - resolve issues with utf8 input on slow links
  - NAWS responses of 0x0 ('ConnectBot') are ignored.
1.0.8
  - UI/bugfixes for last callers (default/lc.py) and default/ttyplay.py
1.0.6, 1.0.7
  - various issues with SyncTerm client resolved in bbs/editor.py and
    default/editor.py, notably: don't draw on bottom line (causes scroll),
    and use 'term.normal' before 'term.red_reverse' or other 'highlight'
    colors, which were otherwise rendered invisible by SyncTerm.
  - some timing negotiations lengthened for very-high latency links, and
    dec vt query removed, it was found useless, increasing connect-time.
1.0.5
  - please add/merge in new 'default.ini' and 'logging.ini' values.
    You can move away your old files, start x84, then compare. There are
    new sections such as [lord], [dosemu], and [door].
  - last callers database must be rebuilt for migrations, this is the default
    "debug" door for sysops, press ctrl + _ from the main menu to rebuild.
    otherwise only new callers will appear.
  - otherwise, this new release includes general display and bug fixes and
    door support for LORD/dosemu, bbs/door.py and default/lord.py.
